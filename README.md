This script converts FORTRAN77 files to modern fortran. Originally from: http://lemonlab.net/fortran/, but since the old BitBucket repo disappeard, I created a mirror with an old version I could find. Newer versions are welcome.

1. Make f2f.pl executable: `chmod +x f2f.pl`
2. run `./f2f.pl old_timey_FORTRAN.f new_Fortran.f90`
